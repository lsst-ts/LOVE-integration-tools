# run web application and open Cypress Test Runner in a Docker container
# but send the X11 output to the server running on the host machine
# so you can see and interact with the tests. Most services are configured
# in the file docker-compose.yml, this file only overrides variables
# necessary for "cypress open" to work with X11.
# We need to use both file names to run:
#
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f cy-open.yml up --exit-code-from cypress
#
services:
  cypress:
    # pass custom command to start Cypress otherwise it will use the entrypoint
    # specified in the Cypress Docker image.
    # also pass "--project <folder>" so that when Cypress opens
    # it can find file "cypress.json" and show integration specs
    # https://on.cypress.io/command-line#cypress-open
    entrypoint: cypress open --project /e2e
    # entrypoint: cypress run --headed --spec /e2e/cypress/integration/*
